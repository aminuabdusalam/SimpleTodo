## Notes

**Challenges encountered while building the app.**

I was doing a lot of learning as I was I was building the app, so that increased the time taken to build the app.

I implemented additional code to allow user tap a todo item and bring up an edit screen, but the app kept stopping abruptly when I tested 
the implementation on the android emulator (Attempting to fix this bug took a long of time and I am still working on fixing the bug).
